#  single and multiple inheritance 

# class dad ():
#     def bike (self):
#         print("son can also use my bike")

# class mom ():
#     def dish (self):
#         print("whole family can have my dish.")

#     def ride (self):
#         print("i only ride the bike")

# jack = son()
# jack.ride()
# jack.bike()
# jack.dish()

# Multi level inheritance  :

# class grandpa ():   # (dad,son): cannot br used bcauz code only see top to bottom so that dad and son are not defined
#         def phone (self):
#         print ("my son and my grand son can use my accessories.")

# class dad (grandpa):
#     def cash(self):

#         print("i can access mine , my dad and grandpa through my dad")

# nun = son ()
# nun.mine()
# nun.phone()

# non = dad()
# non.cash()
# non.phone()

# noon = grandpa()
# noon.cash()

# Hierarchical inheritance :
 
# class dad (): # single class can be used by multiple classes 
#     def money(self):
#         print("sons can access my money..")
# class son1 (dad):
#     pass
# class son2 (dad):
#     pass
# class son3 (dad):
#     pass

# s2 = son2()
# s2.money()

# Hybrid inheritance
 # single , multiple , multilevel , hierarchical are mixed in one so they are hybrid inheritance.

# class dad ():
#         def money ():
#             print("sons can access my money..")

# class land ():
#     def imp():
#         print("this land belongs to all my sons")
             
# class son1 (dad,land):
#     pass
# class son2 (dad):
#     pass
# class son3 (dad):
#     pass

# s2 = son2()
# s2.money()

# super keyword in python 
   # if the constructor in the class it will run the same class or it is not there it will inherit from the parent class
