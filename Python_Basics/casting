#converting one data type into another data type
#within the quotation marks whatever it is considered as a string,so here s+s = ss
#a="20"
#b="30"
#a=int("20")
#b=int("30")
#c=a+b
#print(c)

#while getting input from the user it is just saving a string ,so we make there casting lets see eg

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a+b
print(c)
